Requirements: Windows OS, Python, ExpressVPN, F.lux, AHK

Background: When I created these scripts, my setup involved 3 monitors, with the middle one being shared between my work laptop and my gaming PC. During work I would use my gaming PC to listen to music or podcasts and when work was over and I wanted to play video games, I would have to switch several settings to optimize the PC for gaming, so I decided to automate the process.

Three "modes" are available:
Gaming, Work, Weekend

Gaming:
  Sets middle monitor as primary monitor
  Sets headphones as primary audio device
  Closes VPN
  Closes F.lux (screen warmer application)
  Minimizes all windows except gaming-related ones

Work:
  Sets right monitor as primary monitor
  Sets speakers as primary audio device
  Opens VPN
  Opens F.lux
  Closes gaming-related applictions
  
Weekend:
  Sets middle monitor as primary monitor
  Sets speakers as primary audio device
  Opens VPN
  Opens F.lux
  Closes gaming-related applictions
