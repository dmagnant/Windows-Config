Requirements: Windows OS, Python, ExpressVPN, F.lux, AHK

Background: When I created these scripts, my setup involved 3 monitors, with the middle one being shared between my work laptop and my gaming PC. During work I would use my gaming PC to listen to music or podcasts and when work was over and I wanted to play video games, I would have to switch several settings to optimize the PC for gaming, so I decided to automate the process.

Three "modes" are available:

Gaming, 
Work, 
Weekend

The following items are changed based on the modes above:

Primary monitor, 
Primary audio device, 
VPN and Screen Warmer applications (open/close), 
Gaming-related applications (minimize/maximize)
